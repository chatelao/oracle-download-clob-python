# JAVA ROADMAP - CLOB Download and Upload Tool

This roadmap outlines the plan to port the CLOB Download and Upload Tool from Python to Java, as defined in `JAVA_CONCEPT.md` and `JAVA_DESIGN.md`.

## Progress Overview

| Phase | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Phase 1 | Project Initialization & Environment Setup | ✅ |
| Phase 2 | Core Component Implementation | ✅ |
